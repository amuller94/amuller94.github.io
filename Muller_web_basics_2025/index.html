                <p>This is a website about my Dungeons & Dragons campaign, because it's one of my favorite things in the world and I have a captive audience!</p>
                <p>My friends Sarah, Leon, Maggie, and I started a game of D&D in November of 2019. We had all been listening to "actual play" shows, 
                    where a cast plays a tabletop roleplaying game (TTRPG) for an audience, and felt inspired to try ourselves. On November 20 of that year, we sat down at Sarah and Leon's apartment to create characters.</p>
                <p>We were playing a prewritten module called Waterdeep Dragon Heist, for levels 1-5. In about a year and a half, we had finished the module and wanted
                    to keep going. Maggie, who was DMing (running the game) for us, wrote some homebrew material in a fey setting. We leveled up to 6 and kept going. By then, we'd
                    pretty much decided we wanted to take these characters all the way through to level 20, the highest that characters can go.</p>
                <p>We are now level 17. The end is almost in sight, and we're all feeling pretty dang sentimental about it. Hence this project.</p>
